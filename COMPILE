Glimmer COMPILE file
===================

This version of the code has been sucessfully tested under three compilers:
Compaq Visual Fortran on Windows, and the Intel and Portland Group compilers 
on Linux and SUN WS 6.0 on Sun Solaris systems.

Prerequisites:
=============

* The netCDF library
  get it from here: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
  you need to make sure that the f90 bindings are also installed

Compiling under Unix/Linux:
==========================

You can control where glimmer is installed by setting the GLIMMER_PREFIX
variable.

Files will be installed in the usual places:

$GLIMMER_PREFIX/bin   for executables
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/lib   for libraries
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/mod   for modules
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/share for data files

If GLIMMER_PREFIX is not set, install paths will default to the checked out directory, 
./glimmer

Makefiles are provided for both the SLAP library and the Glimmer code. The
general sequence of commands to compile and link under Unix/Linux is as
follows, assuming you start in the top-level glimmer directory. The Makefile
will resolve dependencies automatically.

make
   will compile all libraries and programs
make install
   will install everything in $GLIMMER_PREFIX
make clean
   will delete unneeded files

Compiling/running glimmer_example
=================================

All that should be necessary for this is:

make
make install
cd data
../bin/glimmer_example

The example runs for 50,000 years, in a 20km resolution domain covering Greenland.

Compilation Options:
====================

Parameters required by make are contained in makefile.arc (in the same manner
currently used by Genie). There are a number of architecture dependent parameter 
files. Find the one (or create a new one) most suited and create a symbolic link to
makefile.arc. The relevant variables for Glimmer are F77 and
F77FLAGS, which specify the compiler command and flags to use,
respectively. Note that although F77 is indicated, a FORTRAN 90 compiler is
required. The required values of these variables for the different compilers
is as follows:

1) Intel Fortran Compiler:

   F77      = ifort (for v.8 of the compiler, otherwise ifc)
   F77FLAGS = -fpp

   In addition, the environment variable F_UFMTENDIAN must be set before
   compilation begins, to enable big-endian-little-endian conversion. This may
   be done in BASH as follows:

      > export F_UFMTENDIAN=big

   and in CSH thus:

      > setenv F_UFMTENDIAN big

2) Portland Group Compiler:

   F77	    = pgf90
   F77FLAGS = -Mpreprocess -byteswapio


Compiling Glimmer as part of a larger climate model
===================================================

When using Glimmer with a climate model, compile the SLAP and Glimmer
libraries as described above. Link to them using the following compiler
options:

-L[path] -lglimmer -lslap

where [path] is the location of the library files (the glimmer/lib
directory, if they haven't been moved elsewhere.)

An additional compiler option will also be required so that the compiler can
find the .mod files. In come compilers this is done with the include path
specification -I[path]. By default, the .mod files are copied to the
glimmer/mod directory.

Remember that if you want to move the library files (libslap.a and
libglimmer.a), the .mod files need to be moved as well (or the compiler told
where to find them)

Compiling Glimmer under Windows:
===============================

Compilation using Compaq Visual Fortran is not entirely straightforward,
since there is the need for custom build steps to generate .f90 files from the
.f90.in files. However, if you are willing to delve into the Unix/Linux
makefiles to discover how this is accomplished, it is possible. 

Using the netcdf library under Windows raises its own problems, since the
pre-built netcdf files distributed by Unidata don't include the f90 interface
(this is because there is no standardisation to .mod files, so each compiler
uses its own format). The best course of action is to download the source, and
build solely the f90 interface, linking to the pre-built f77/C library. This
will generate a .mod file appropriate to your compiler which can then be
placed into the include search path.

When compiling under Windows, remember to import the SLAP library files as
well as the files in the top-level directory into the visual studio
environment. Note also that not all the files in the main src/fortran
directory are part of the glimmer library - the following are not:

bin2ncdf.f90
glimmer_example.f90
input2ncdf.f90
relaxed.f90
test_config.f90

Nevertheless, glimmer_example.f90 is just that - an example utilisation of the
glimmer library.
