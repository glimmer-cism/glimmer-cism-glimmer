Glimmer COMPILE file
===================

This version of the code has been sucessfully tested under three compilers:
Compaq Visual Fortran on Windows, and the Intel and Portland Group compilers 
on Linux and SUN WS 6.0 on Sun Solaris systems.

Prerequisites:
=============
* The netCDF library
  get it from here: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
  you need to make sure that the f90 bindings are also installed

Compiling under Windows:
=======================

Compilation using Compaq Visual Fortran can be achieved in the usual way,
setting up a workspace and importing the appropriate files. Remember to import
the SLAP library files as well as the files in the top-level directory. 

Before compilation, the following must be done:

1) Enable preprocessor
2) Define preprocessor symbol CVF

This will automatically compile the example file (example_glimmer.f90) and
link appropriately. However, for the model to run, the input files need to be
copied from the data directory into the working directory.


Compiling under Unix/Linux:
==========================

You can control where glimmer is installed by setting the GLIMMER_PREFIX variable.
Files will be installed in the usual places:
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/bin   for executables
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/lib   for libraries
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/mod   for modules
$GLIMMER_PREFIX/share for data files
If GLIMMER_PREFIX is not set, install paths will default to the checked out directory, 
./glimmer

Makefiles are provided for both the SLAP library and the Glimmer code. The
general sequence of commands to compile and link under Unix/Linux is as
follows, assuming you start in the glimmer/src/fortran directory (the one with
the model code in). The Makefile will resolve dependencies automatically.

make
   will compile all libraries and programs
make install
   will install everything in $GLIMMER_PREFIX
make clean
   will delete unneeded files

Compilation Options:
====================
Parameters required by make are contained in makefile.arc (in the same manner
currently used by Genie). There are a number of architecture dependent parameter 
files. Find the one (create a new one) most suited and create a symbolic link to
makefile.arc. The relevant variables for Glimmer are F77 and
F77FLAGS, which specify the compiler command and flags to use,
respectively. Note that although F77 is indicated, a FORTRAN 90 compiler is
required. The required values of these variables for the different compilers
is as follows:

1) Intel Fortran Compiler:

   F77      = ifc
   F77FLAGS = -fpp

   In addition, the environment variable F_UFMTENDIAN must be set before
   compilation begins, to enable big-endian-little-endian conversion. This may
   be done in BASH as follows:

      > export F_UFMTENDIAN=big

   and in CSH thus:

      > setenv F_UFMTENDIAN big

2) Portman Group Compiler:

   F77	    = pgf90
   F77FLAGS = -Mpreprocess -byteswapio


Compiling Glimmer as part of a larger climate model
===================================================

When using Glimmer with a climate model, compile the SLAP and Glimmer
libraries as described above. Link to them using the following compiler
options:

-L[path] -lglimmer -lslap

where [path] is the location of the library files (the glimmer/lib
directory, if they haven't been moved elsewhere.)

An additional compiler option will also be required so that the compiler can
find the .mod files. In come compilers this is done with the include path
specification -I[path]. By default, the .mod files are copied to the
glimmer/mod directory.

Remember that if you want to move the library files (libslap.a and
libglimmer.a), the .mod files need to be moved as well (or the compiler told
where to find them)
