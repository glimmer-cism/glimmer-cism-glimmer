Changes in Version 0.5.2
========================
This is the EGU 2005 special release!
* improvements of glint
* updated docs
* move surface and horiz deriv calculations to thck_evolve 
  (this changes results slightly!)

Changes in Version 0.5.1
========================
* Bugfix on snow-depth accumulation in GLINT
* Enabled fractional-year netcdf writing of snow and
  superimposed ice depth in GLINT
* Changed glint_example to use correct NCEP precip forcing.
  This entailed adding some interpolation, since the precip
  and temp are no longer on the same global grid.

Changes in Version 0.5.0
========================
* this is our first release!

Changes in Version 0.3.0
========================
* added micro version

Changes in Version 0.3
======================
* slight change in configuration file format, the following sections 
  were renamed to
  [default] -> [CF default]
  [output]  -> [CF output]
  [input]   -> [CF input]
* model version is handled by configure.in script
* we've got a glimmer-config script
* renamed some files and fixed module name space
* general glint clean-up
* updated doc (a never-ending task)
* model data can be accessed via accessor subroutines
  these hide scaling at a performance penalty
