Changes in Version 0.5.6
========================
* The documentation was moved into a separate module, glimmer-doc.
* Improved built system. You can now compile GLIMMER out of tree.
  GLIMMER also installs an m4 macro which you can use to set up paths to
  GLIMMER.
* Added time averages for some variables
* Derive logfile name from config file name
* Lots of little improvements of the various drivers

Changes in Version 0.5.4
========================
* The way version numbers are handled has changed. Releases have
  even numbers. Once a release was made the version number is 
  increased by 1 for the development branch. Eventually, when we 
  think we accumulated enough stuff we will make a new release.
* The version string now also includes whether we compile from
  CVS or not.
* new mass balance model, RAPID
* optionally calculate heat flux in lithosphere
* glide configuration parser is now in it's own subroutine which
  must be called after the configuration file has been read in and
  before glide is initialised.
* resurrect ADI scheme
* utility function for integrating functions (Romberg integration)
* new procedures for handling coordinate systems
* new variable for basal shear stress
* improve documentation
* many bug fixes

Changes in Version 0.5.2
========================
This is the EGU 2005 special release!
* improvements of glint
* updated docs
* move surface and horiz deriv calculations to thck_evolve 
  (this changes results slightly!)

Changes in Version 0.5.1
========================
* Bugfix on snow-depth accumulation in GLINT
* Enabled fractional-year netcdf writing of snow and
  superimposed ice depth in GLINT
* Changed glint_example to use correct NCEP precip forcing.
  This entailed adding some interpolation, since the precip
  and temp are no longer on the same global grid.

Changes in Version 0.5.0
========================
* this is our first release!

Changes in Version 0.3.0
========================
* added micro version

Changes in Version 0.3
======================
* slight change in configuration file format, the following sections 
  were renamed to
  [default] -> [CF default]
  [output]  -> [CF output]
  [input]   -> [CF input]
* model version is handled by configure.in script
* we've got a glimmer-config script
* renamed some files and fixed module name space
* general glint clean-up
* updated doc (a never-ending task)
* model data can be accessed via accessor subroutines
  these hide scaling at a performance penalty
  
Changes in Version 0.2
======================
* use autotools for generating Makefiles
