ISMIP-HOM Experiments
=====================
This is a set of intercomparison experiments meant to test the
implementation of higher-order physics.  
For more information, see the ISMIP-HOM page at
http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/ismip/

PREREQUISITES:
In order to use the ISMIP-HOM scripts, you will need Python and the 
following modules installed:
PyCDF
Numpy

To produce visuals, you will also need to install the Python
matplotlib library.  You will also need to download the ISMIP-HOM
submitted results from:
http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/ismip/tc-2-95-2008-supplement.zip
and unzip to a directory named ismip_all

RUNNING THE TESTS:
To run ISMIP-HOM A through D for all domain sizes, invoke the verification script:

python verify.py (or ./verify.py)

You can limit the experiments or the domain sizes.  To run A through D for only 40-160 kilometer domains:

python verify.py --size=40,80,160

To run A and C for all domain sizes:

python verify.py --exp=a,c

Short versions of the arguments are also accepted:

python verify.py -ea,c -s40,80,160

VISUALIZING OUTPUT:
To produce a visual showing how your model output compares to published results, run the createVisuals.py script.
Make sure to pass the same arguments that you did to verify.py, otherwise the script may choke as it is missing
output files.
