The original stand-alone ice model was written by Tony Payne. The 
subsequent coupling, down/up-scaling and other associated code  was
written by Ian Rutt. A significant amount of re-engineering of the original 
model was done by Ian Rutt and Magnus Hagdorn. Magnus Hagdorn also added netCDF 
support and changed the built system.
