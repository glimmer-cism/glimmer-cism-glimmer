   atm...
 * Changed doc build so that DIA doesn't display splash screen (added -n)

 * Added area considerations of mean_to_local subroutine in glimmer_interp.f90 (not used
   in glimmer itself).

2004-10-21 Ian Rutt
 * Sorted out water budgeting. This is something of a fudge, for although
   melt and run-off maps are determined reasonably well, an overall constant
   is added to ablation to account for any non-conservation of mass in the dynamics.
 * Also adjusted ablation calculations so as not to remove more mass than is present.

2004-10-14 Ian Rutt
 * Fixed problem with coverage map normalisation

   should work. Removed glimmer_degd.f90, since this is now redundant.
 * Updated Unix build system to deal with new file.

2004-07-18 Ian Rutt
 * Added new coding of PDD routines, without any NR code,

2004-07-01 Ian Rutt
 * Added documentation comments to glide_messages.f90

2004-06-30 Ian Rutt
 * Completed standardisation of message system - six levels are provided,
 from 'diagnostics' to 'fatal errors'. The overall message level can be
 set by calling glide_set_msg_level. Two output subroutines are provided:
 glide_msg and glide_stars; the latter prints a line of 70 stars across
 the screen.

 * Fixed Linux build system after my changes yesterday (the problems of
 doing development under Windows...)

2004-06-29 Ian Rutt

 * added CF projections (Makefile, glimmer_CFproj.f90, ncdf_file.f90.in, ncdf_infile.f90.in, generate_ncvars.py)
 * glimmer_object.f90: initialise output later so it gets projections from input
 * ncdf.f90.in: moved error handle out of module

 * Merged netCDF_IO branch into main trunk - seems to work OK. 
   *** NB *** The new capability to mask out some parts of the domain
   was developed in parallel with the netCDF stuff, and hasn't yet
   been fully integrated into the netcdf structure. That's the next step -
   I thought it wise not to attempt too much at once!
 * The previous unmerged version of the HEAD is tagged as PRE_NETCDF_IO
 * Added informative comment to glimmer_thck.f90
	
2004-06-04 Magnus Hagdorn
 * made variable names case sensitive (g_land.glw, generate_ncvars.py)
 * split up user guide into individual sections
 * added netCDF and config file documentation
	
2004-06-03 Magnus Hagdorn
 * found some more unused filenames and removed out_stem with ncfile

2004-06-03 Magnus Hagdorn
 * removed unused filenames for namelists and structures
   usrffile, topgfile, relxfile, prcpfile, presusrffile, latifile

2004-06-03 Ian Rutt
 * Added dependency of f90_dep.mak on the Makefile and makefile.arc
 * Cancelled implicit rule that tries to make .o files out of .mod files
 using the MODULA-2 compiler (m2c), which sometimes causes build problems.

2004-06-01 Magnus Hagdorn
 * new documentation structure
	
2004-05-27 Ian Rutt
 * Fixed problems with polar stereographic projection and interpolation routines.

2004-05-25 Ian Rutt
 * Added comment to main glimmer subroutine

2004-05-24 Magnus Hagdorn
 * added some standard name attributes (ncdf_file.f90.in, ncdf_vars.def)
	
2004-05-24 Magnus Hagdorn
 * g_land.gln: removed outs namelist
 * glimmer_global.f90: added version string
 * ncdf_file.f90.in, generate_ncvars.py: renamed loop index sp to spot
 * glimmer_config.f90: fixed silly bug
 * added global meta data to netCDF output (g_land.glw, ncdf.f90.in, ncdf_file.f90.in, ncdf_params.f90.in)

2004-05-24 Ian Rutt
 * Sorted out input and output arrays of water flux, and added diagnostic
	outputs of total water fluxes and ice sheet volume.
 * Fixed ice model so that ice thickness isn't accumulated twice on first time-step.

2004-05-19 Ian Rutt
 * Fixed problem with array sizes in glimmer.f90. Here, the size of
	temporary arrays was based on the size of optional arguments,
	which isn't allowed. Replaced them will allocatable arrays.
 * Fixed problem with build system - added glimmer_global_grid.f90
	
2004-05-18 Magnus Hagdorn
 * added integer and real array parameters (test_config.conf, glimmer_config.f90, test_config.f90)
 * removed indices0dx and indices0dy (glimmer_setup.f90, glimmer_restart.f90, glimmer_modu.f90)
 * fully implemented spot variables (ncdf.f90.in, ncdf_file.f90.in, ncdf_params.f90.in, ncdf_vars.def, generate_ncvars.py)
	
2004-05-18 Magnus Hagdorn
 * initialised pointers to NULL() to fix segfault with NAG compiler (ncdf_params.f90.in)
 * added debug flags to makefile.nag

2004-05-17 Magnus Hagdorn
 * working around silly problem with Intel compiler. I am still not quite sure what the problem is,
   but config reader API had to be changed from functions to subroutines
   (glimmer_config.f90, test_config.f90, ncdf_params.f90.in)
 * makefile.ifc: added DEBUG flags, renamed compiler to ifort
 * replaced binary input files g20lati, g20prcp, g20relx, g20surf, g20thck, g20topg with netCDF input
   file g_land.input.nc. This is also reflected in netCDF control file (g_land.glw)

2004-05-17 Ian Rutt
 * Added copy_global_grid subroutine to glimmer_global_grid.f90
 * Added capability to specify grid-box boundaries when initialising model,
 	using optional arguments in initialise_glimmer().
 * Updated documentation.
 * Corrected instance namelist read - forc was absent.

2004-05-14 Magnus Hagdorn
 netCDF input, Round 1
 * add netCDF input capabilities, removed old I/O bits
	
2004-05-14 Magnus Hagdorn
 netCDF output, Round 1
 * glimmer/data: output file configuration format changed to something similar to Windows .ini files (g_land.glw)
                 added a new directory containg test data files (test/test_config.conf)
 * new configuration file parser (glimmer_config.f90/test_config.f90)
 * glimmer_interp.f90: SUN compiler complains about a functions passed as dummy arguments which are not declared external
 * ncdf_params.f90.in, generate_ncvars.py: netCDF output file configuration reader
 * ncdf.f90.in: initialise variables to sensible defaults
 * ncdf_file.f90.in: added subroutines openall_out and writeall
 * glimmer_modu.f90, glimmer_object.f90: hooked up netCDF output

2004-05-14 Ian Rutt
 * Added output-masking capability to enable overlapping domains to be
	more easily dealt with.
 * Fixed polar stereographic projection. However, the stereographic
	projections still fail if the pole is in the domain - not sure why.
 * Implemented new, better downscaling-interpolation scheme, which handles
	the presence of a pole better, and take into account the irregular
	shape of the interpolation domain.
 * Added proper default initialisation of top-level glimmer type.
	
2004-05-12 Ian Rutt
 * Removed redundant re_alloc flag argument from proj_allocate subroutine
	in glimmer_project.f90

2004-05-11 Ian Rutt
 * Removed redundant xscale and yscale components from projection type, 
	which were originally set equal to dx and dy. All references to
	them have been changed accordingly.

2004-05-10 Magnus Hagdorn
 * input2ncdf.f90: actually does what it is supposed to
 * ncdf_vars.def: added presusrf, present day surface of the ice-sheet
 * generate_ncvars.py: don't write variables associated with spots if no spots are selected

2004-05-10 Magnus Hagdorn
 * added spot variables (generate_ncvars.py, ncdf_vars.def, ncdf.f90.in, ncdf_file.f90.in)
 * bin2ncdf.f90: does 3D now as well, there is a bug with the 0D time series.
 * input2ncdf.f90: start of a tool to convert glimmer input files to netCDF file

2004-05-08 Magnus Hagdorn
 * first round of netCDF stuff
   generate_ncvars.py: code generator taking netCDF file description
	(ncdf_vars.def) to produce f90 files from inputfiles .f90.in
	ncdf.f90.in basic data structures
	ncdf_file.f90.in file I/O operations
 * bin2ncdf.f90: testing netCDF stuff and converting old datafiles 
	(2D only at the moment) to new netCDF

2004-05-06 Ian Rutt
 * Rationalisation of calc_coverage (glimmer_object.f90), with 
	global grid objects.
 * Minor formatting changes.
 * Completed adding initialisation to derived types and rejigging
	namelist reads to avoid confusion about default values.
 * Coded alternative, hopefully faster calc_coverage routine.
 * Made efficiency alterations to new_upscale code.
 * Duplicated mean_to_global (glimmer_interp.f90) in single and
	double precision copies (in terms of array local) and
	added appropriate aliasing interface block. This was to
	allow the addition of a compile flag to invoke a single-precision
	interface (compile with GLIMMER_SP defined).
 * Corrected error in GMT code - sines and cosines being taken without 
	converting from degrees to radians!

2004-05-05 Ian Rutt
 * Realised several crucial aspects of the orography output were
	missing, so added them. Produces orography as expected now,
	but some structural changes are needed, I think.
 * Restructured code so that global grid definitions have their own 
	derived type, which simplifies things. However, more rationalisation 
	and simplification still possible
 * Minor formatting, and removal of redundant stress arrays

2004-05-04 Ian Rutt
 * Added upscale type to glimmer_interp.f90 and adjusted code 
  	accodingly. This was to enable the output of orography 
	at any resolution, as needed by the IGCM. 
 * ***NB*** This hasn't been tested properly yet, and the
	restarts have been broken by it, as there wasn't time
 	to add routine writing the upscaling to a restart file
 * Other minor formating changes, and addition of null pointer
	initialisation in some places

2004-04-27 Ian Rutt
 * Added doc comments to gmt.f90
 * Updated return value documentation throughout to !*RV
 * Other minor documentation and formatting changes
 * Moved glimmer_params initialisation to type definition
	in line with move to f95, and added null 
	initialisation for pointer arrays. (glimmer.f90)
 * Checked all elements of glimmer_params correctly
	included in restart routines and in consistent
	order. This should work OK, but hasn't been tested...

2004-04-26 Ian Rutt
 * Merged port_to_nag branch into HEAD
 * Extended interpolation routines (glimmer_interp.f90) to include 
	averaging high-resolution global field onto local
	grid. Also generalised find_ll_index somewhat to cope 
	with longitudes that have limits other than 0->360 
	(e.g. 180->360, 0->180). This may need more work, though.
 * Added matlab visualisation routines to the repository.

2004-04-19 Magnus Hagdorn
 * added ChangeLog
 * added NAG f95 makros
 * new build system (using Python script to work out module dependencies)
 * reduced number of time slices in example code to 10000yrs
 * made kind rk=dp (rather than 8)
 * (glimmer_outp.f90) integer array index
 * added SUN WS f95 makros
 * (glimmer_restart.f90, glimmer_interp.f90) workaround for SUN WS compiler bug
 * (glimmer.f90, glimmer_velo.f90) avoid division by zero
 * removed unused symbols and unused module symbols
