2007-03-27 Ian Rutt
 * Build fixes:
	1) Adjusted make_restarts.py to avoid over-running line length limit
	2) Removed glimmer_vers.F90
	3) Fixed module naming problems with glint_ebm_clim.F90 and glimmer_routing.F90
	
2007-03-16 Bill Lipscomb
	Added a new module, glide_diagnostics.F90.  For now, this module
	contains the single subroutine glide_write_diag, which I moved
	from glide.F90. 
	
2007-03-14 Bill Lipscomb
	A new branch, 'lipscomb_1_5_1', with the following changes and additions:
	(1) Modified file and module names so that they are consistent with each other.
	    E.g., the module in file glimmer_physcon.F90 is now called glimmer_physcon
	    instead of physcon.  This change was necessary to compile code in the
	    Community Climate System Model (CCSM) build system.  I made minor changes
	    in use statements, etc. in a large number of files.
	(2) Added an incremental remapping transport scheme.  This scheme can be run
	    in either or two modes.  Set evolution = 3 to remap the thickness field,
	    treating temperature as in standard glimmer.  Set evolution = 4 to remap
	    thickness as well as temperature and ice age.
	(3) Added three new modules with the prefix "glissade."  The remapping module
	    is in glissade_remap.F90 and is called from glissade.F90.  Some constants
	    used by these modules are in glissade_constants.F90.  The idea here is to
	    identify my new modules with a distinct prefix (one that starts with "gl",
	    naturally).  Glissade code will be checked into the main trunk as requested
	    by the Glimmer community, but otherwise will probably be confined to a
	    branch I use for code development.
	(4) Added an ice age tracer.  For standard glimmer the tracer is initialized
	    to zero and not computed.  For glimmer with remapping (evolution = 4), ice
	    age is incremented at each time step and advected conservatively.
	(5) Added a subroutine for writing diagnostic output.  For now this subroutine
	    is in glide.F90, though perhaps it should live somewhere else.  I like to
	    call this subroutine every once in a while as a sanity check and as
	    an easy way to check bit-for-bit agreement between two runs.
	(6) Added an optional temperature smoother in glide_temp.  Not surprisingly,
	    if you turn up the smoothing high enough, the EISMINT2 spokes go away.  
	    This smoothing is not intended to be physically realistic; it is just
	    a tool for use with the EISMINT tests.
        Note: Most of my changes are marked with '!lipscomb' comments which should be
	      cleaned up later when the code is committed to the main trunk.

 * Wrote basic code to handle file information in restart files

2006-09-25 Ian Rutt (from RESTART_ON_DEMAND)
 * Made restart compilation and generation optional (using configure
 option --enable-restarts)
 * Rewrote restart generation to produce only two include files (one for
 the header info, one for the module body).
 * Wrote top-level interface code for restarts
	
2006-09-20 Ian Rutt
 * Added feature so that config file data is automatically added to output
 netcdf files as attribute.

 plain text.

2006-09-19 Ian Rutt (from RESTART_ON_DEMAND)
 * First rough go at restart on demand completed.

 depth <= specified level, rather than just less-than.
 * Fixed some bugs with water-budget accounting in glint.

2006-09-06 Ian Rutt
 * Began adding base code for restart-on-demand. This is
 glimmer_restart_common.F90, which provides a set of NetCDF routines for
 dumping arbitrary sequences of variables/arrays to file and retrieving
 them.

2006-08-25 Ian Rutt
 * Plumbed in new projection code. Tested successfully.
 * Retained capability to pase [GLINT projection] config section, but
 warning issued. This is a deprecated feature and should be removed at
 some point.
 * Fixed bug in glimmer_config.F90. Array-reading code now correctly
 parses arrays with varying sizes - a pointer array of the correct length
 is returned.

2006-08-22 Ian Rutt
 * Finished consolidated projection code. Tested against exisiting
 projection code where available, and against itself (i.e. forward and
 reverse transformations agree) where projection is new. Ready to be
 plumbed in.

2006-08-21 Ian Rutt
 * Completed first go through re-jigging of projection transformation and
 CF handling code. Still to be integrated into build and tested.

2006-08-18 Ian Rutt

2006-08-09 Ian Rutt
 * Fixed pointer nullification bug in glimmer_ncparms.F90 (Thanks to Oli
 Browne for finding this one).
 * Fixed glint logging bug - multiple instances generated fort.101
 file. Moved close log outside glide_finalise and updated all driver
 programs accordingly.

2006-08-01 Ian Rutt
 * Corrected typo: finialise_elastic -> finalise_elastic

2006-06-18 Magnus Hagdorn

2006-06-18 Magnus Hagdorn
 * src/fortran/Makefile.am: rename files *.f90 -> *.F90
 * src/python/generate_ncvars.py: ditto
 * src/fortran/*.f90: rename to *.F90, add preprocessor machinery to load
   config.inc

 * glide_types.f90: add new variable for averaging annual 
   massbalance

2006-05-18 Ian Rutt

 derived type element)

2006-05-10 Ian Rutt
 * Minor enhancements/bugfixes to EISMINT3GL driver
 * Minor doc change in glide_types.f90 (thanks, Oli)
	
2006-05-02 Ian Rutt
 * Added temperature half-range to glint output variables as glint_arng
 * Cleared up series of important confusions/bugs in mass-balance
 calculations in glint. Note that all mass-balance calculations in glint,
 including in the two PDD schemes are done in terms of water-equivalent
 depths. The mass balance is then converted to ice-equivalent depth at the
 point where the glide timestep subroutines are called.
	
2006-04-27 Ian Rutt
 * Final version of EISMINT3 Greenland scenario. Can choose to start from
 present-day ice sheet or from no ice.
 * Added new calving scheme (marine ice edge/threshold based) and tidied
 up calving code (removed strange unknown option which was left over from
 old model)
	
2006-04-25 Ian Rutt
 * Removed redundant GLIDE options (sliding_law and stress_calc)

2006-04-20 Magnus Hagdorn
 * configure.in: when looking for Sun compiler also grep for Forte

2006-04-20 Ian Rutt
 * Added driver for EISMINT3 Greenland scenario, based on Magi's EISMINT
 1 & 2 drivers.
 * Added option to specify topography as being in isostatic equilibrium
 and thus calculate relaxed topography on the fly.

2006-02-22 Ian Rutt
 * Corrected CF mapping compliance in glimmer_CFproj.f90; this time,
 changed LAEA projection.

2006-02-09 Ian Rutt
 * Rewrote parts of glint_initialise to allow the specification of an
   array of parameter files for individual instances in the API, as an
   alternative to a top-level parameter file that points to the
   instances. This is so that we can also supply an array of config file
   types to overwrite parameters read from files, but need to be sure of
   the ordering when doing so. 
 * Added a non-pointer wrapper type to glimmer_config, to allow the
   creation of arrays of config data types. These can now be passed to
   glint_initialise using array constructors or whatever method you like,
   and will overwrite the data loaded from file
 * Also added some overloaded subroutines to allow access to and
   combination of these types
 * For the purposes of identifying config sections where there may be more
   than one instance in a given file, the value of the key 'tag' is now
   significant. If one is setting a value in a config file, a tag may now
   be specified, and if a section with that tag is found, the value is set
   there, otherwise a new, tagged section is created.
	
2006-02-08 Ian Rutt
 * Added subroutine to glimmer_config.f90 to allow the merging of two
   config file types. This means that an additional config file can be read,
   passed to glint as an instance of ConfigSection, and then merged with
   another config file. 
	
2006-02-07 Ian Rutt
 * Added subroutine to glimmer_config.f90 to allow arbitrary addition or
   overwriting of config file entries once file has been read. This is
   a first step towards allowing the arbitrary passing of runtime
   parameters through glint API.

2006-01-31 Ian Rutt
 * Added snow densification to daily PDD scheme, and rewrote core of the
   scheme to make it more logical. Tested fairly thoroughly.

2006-01-19 Ian Rutt
 * Corrected CF mapping compliance in glimmer_CFproj.f90
 * Added ability to write CF-compilant mapping info to glimmer_proj.f90
 * (need to combine these two bits of code at some point)

   This was requested, but is a big fudge, which I'm not terribly happy
   with. It might not work, either.

   non-standard Fortran extensions in the intel compiler - can be
   selected at compile-time by defining preprocessor symbol GLEX_COM_LINE.
   Needed to do this to facilitate batch processing of glint runs on
   our Beowulf cluster, but obviously it's non-ideal.
 * Corrected error in comment in glint_vars.def

 * Extended length of variables used to construct log messages to 150
   chars
 * Fixed problem with single-precision compilation
 * Converted awi.f to f90 (glint_global_interp.f90) - needs a bit more
   work, but functions correctly.
	
2005-03-17 Ian Rutt
 * Removed printing of ierr after calling awi.f
 * Released at version 0.5.1

2005-03-16 Ian Rutt
 * Added some dodgy f77 interpolation code (awi.f) to deal with problems I
 had with different global grids in NCEP data used to force
 glint_example. It is my aim to convert this to f90 soon.
 * Changed glint_example to deal with new precip data

2005-03-14 Ian Rutt
 * Adapted netcdf code to handle fractional year-lengths and added
  handling in GLINT for writing mass-balance information at these times
 * Fixed snow-depth to be accumulated on land only
 * Sorted out glint_example so the run goes all the way to the beginning

 * Removed NAG-non-compliant section and value name checking from glimmer_setup.f90

2005-01-31 Ian Rutt
 * Reverted last change, since it was based on a misunderstanding. _No_ fields are spliced
   into the input - the splicing takes place as the output fields are prepared from the outputs

2005-01-26 Ian Rutt
 * Changed water flux fields so they replace the input rather than being spliced into it

2005-01-18 Ian Rutt

   $(OBJ_EXT), etc)

2005-01-11 Ian Rutt

2004-11-10 Ian Rutt
 * Changed scale_factor_at_projection_origin to scale_factor_at_proj_origin, to comply

 * Added area considerations of mean_to_local subroutine in glimmer_interp.f90 (not used
   in glimmer itself).

2004-10-21 Ian Rutt
 * Sorted out water budgeting. This is something of a fudge, for although
   melt and run-off maps are determined reasonably well, an overall constant
   is added to ablation to account for any non-conservation of mass in the dynamics.
 * Also adjusted ablation calculations so as not to remove more mass than is present.

2004-10-14 Ian Rutt
 * Fixed problem with coverage map normalisation

2004-10-13 Ian Rutt
 * Reorganised upscaling and field splicing to enable easy output of 
   initial fields to global model at initialisation time.

 than one module per file.

2004-09-16 Ian Rutt
 * Added Tony's physics documentation to main docs.

   glimmer_config.f90.

2004-08-19 Ian Rutt
 * Moved PDD and precip forcing parameters into the namelist, and slightly
   reorganized glimmer_paramets.f90 and glimmer_physcon.f90. Would like to
   get rid of both these files eventually.

 * Changes to some constants to conform with EISMINT-1. These should be
   moved to the configuration files at some point.

2004-08-12 Ian Rutt
 * Added comments to several files: glide_pdd.f90, glimmer_CFproj.f90,
   glimmer_config.f90, glimmer_example.f90.

   should work. Removed glimmer_degd.f90, since this is now redundant.
 * Updated Unix build system to deal with new file.

2004-07-18 Ian Rutt
 * Added new coding of PDD routines, without any NR code,
   (glide_pdd.f90), but not "plumbed in" yet.

2004-07-01 Ian Rutt
 * Added documentation comments to glide_messages.f90

2004-06-30 Ian Rutt
 * Completed standardisation of message system - six levels are provided,
 from 'diagnostics' to 'fatal errors'. The overall message level can be
 set by calling glide_set_msg_level. Two output subroutines are provided:
 glide_msg and glide_stars; the latter prints a line of 70 stars across
 the screen.

 * Fixed Linux build system after my changes yesterday (the problems of
 doing development under Windows...)

2004-06-29 Ian Rutt

 * added files to doc which I had forgotton before (Makefile, varlist.tex.in)
 * added longitudes (glimmer_modu.f90, glimmer_setup.f90, ncdf_vars.def)
 * added CF projections (Makefile, glimmer_CFproj.f90, ncdf_file.f90.in, ncdf_infile.f90.in, generate_ncvars.py)
 * glimmer_object.f90: initialise output later so it gets projections from input

 * Changed allocatable arrays to pointers in input2ncdf.f90, as the Compaq compiler
   has problems passing arrays arguments with the allocatable attribute out of
   subroutines

   the model has no information about them.

2004-06-09 Magnus Hagdorn
 * initialised pointers in glimmer_proj.f90 with NULL()

2004-06-08 Ian Rutt
 * Merged netCDF_IO branch into main trunk - seems to work OK. 
   *** NB *** The new capability to mask out some parts of the domain
   was developed in parallel with the netCDF stuff, and hasn't yet
   been fully integrated into the netcdf structure. That's the next step -
   I thought it wise not to attempt too much at once!
 * The previous unmerged version of the HEAD is tagged as PRE_NETCDF_IO

	outputs of total water fluxes and ice sheet volume.
 * Fixed ice model so that ice thickness isn't accumulated twice on first time-step.

2004-05-19 Ian Rutt

 * added debug flags to makefile.nag

2004-05-17 Magnus Hagdorn
 * working around silly problem with Intel compiler. I am still not quite sure what the problem is,
   but config reader API had to be changed from functions to subroutines
   (glimmer_config.f90, test_config.f90, ncdf_params.f90.in)
 * makefile.ifc: added DEBUG flags, renamed compiler to ifort
 * replaced binary input files g20lati, g20prcp, g20relx, g20surf, g20thck, g20topg with netCDF input

2004-05-14 Magnus Hagdorn
 netCDF input, Round 1
 * add netCDF input capabilities, removed old I/O bits
	
2004-05-14 Magnus Hagdorn
 netCDF output, Round 1
 * glimmer/data: output file configuration format changed to something similar to Windows .ini files (g_land.glw)
                 added a new directory containg test data files (test/test_config.conf)
 * new configuration file parser (glimmer_config.f90/test_config.f90)
 * glimmer_interp.f90: SUN compiler complains about a functions passed as dummy arguments which are not declared external

	more easily dealt with.
 * Fixed polar stereographic projection. However, the stereographic
	projections still fail if the pole is in the domain - not sure why.
 * Implemented new, better downscaling-interpolation scheme, which handles
	the presence of a pole better, and take into account the irregular
	shape of the interpolation domain.
 * Added proper default initialisation of top-level glimmer type.
	
2004-05-12 Ian Rutt
 * Removed redundant re_alloc flag argument from proj_allocate subroutine
	in glimmer_project.f90

 * input2ncdf.f90: start of a tool to convert glimmer input files to netCDF file

2004-05-08 Magnus Hagdorn
 * first round of netCDF stuff

	(ncdf_vars.def) to produce f90 files from inputfiles .f90.in
	ncdf.f90.in basic data structures
	ncdf_file.f90.in file I/O operations

	global grid objects.
 * Minor formatting changes.
 * Completed adding initialisation to derived types and rejigging
	namelist reads to avoid confusion about default values.
 * Coded alternative, hopefully faster calc_coverage routine.
 * Made efficiency alterations to new_upscale code.
 * Duplicated mean_to_global (glimmer_interp.f90) in single and
	double precision copies (in terms of array local) and
	added appropriate aliasing interface block. This was to
	allow the addition of a compile flag to invoke a single-precision
	interface (compile with GLIMMER_SP defined).
 * Corrected error in GMT code - sines and cosines being taken without 
	converting from degrees to radians!

 * Realised several crucial aspects of the orography output were
	missing, so added them. Produces orography as expected now,
	but some structural changes are needed, I think.
 * Restructured code so that global grid definitions have their own 
	derived type, which simplifies things. However, more rationalisation 
	and simplification still possible
 * Minor formatting, and removal of redundant stress arrays

2004-05-04 Ian Rutt
 * Added upscale type to glimmer_interp.f90 and adjusted code 
  	accodingly. This was to enable the output of orography 
	at any resolution, as needed by the IGCM. 
 * ***NB*** This hasn't been tested properly yet, and the
	restarts have been broken by it, as there wasn't time
 	to add routine writing the upscaling to a restart file
 * Other minor formating changes, and addition of null pointer
	initialisation in some places

2004-04-27 Ian Rutt
 * Added doc comments to gmt.f90
 * Updated return value documentation throughout to !*RV
 * Other minor documentation and formatting changes
 * Moved glimmer_params initialisation to type definition
	in line with move to f95, and added null 
	initialisation for pointer arrays. (glimmer.f90)
 * Checked all elements of glimmer_params correctly
	included in restart routines and in consistent
	order. This should work OK, but hasn't been tested...

2004-04-26 Ian Rutt
 * Merged port_to_nag branch into HEAD
 * Extended interpolation routines (glimmer_interp.f90) to include 
	averaging high-resolution global field onto local
	grid. Also generalised find_ll_index somewhat to cope 
	with longitudes that have limits other than 0->360 
	(e.g. 180->360, 0->180). This may need more work, though.
 * Added matlab visualisation routines to the repository.

2004-04-19 Magnus Hagdorn
 * added ChangeLog
 * added NAG f95 makros
 * new build system (using Python script to work out module dependencies)
 * reduced number of time slices in example code to 10000yrs
 * made kind rk=dp (rather than 8)
 * (glimmer_outp.f90) integer array index
 * added SUN WS f95 makros
 * (glimmer_restart.f90, glimmer_interp.f90) workaround for SUN WS compiler bug
 * (glimmer.f90, glimmer_velo.f90) avoid division by zero
 * removed unused symbols and unused module symbols
