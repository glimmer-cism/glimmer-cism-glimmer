 * Added copy_global_grid subroutine to glimmer_global_grid.f90
 * Added capability to specify grid-box boundaries when initialising model,
 	using optional arguments in initialise_glimmer().
 * Updated documentation.
 * Corrected instance namelist read - forc was absent.
	
2004-05-14 Ian Rutt
 * Added output-masking capability to enable overlapping domains to be
	more easily dealt with.
 * Fixed polar stereographic projection. However, the stereographic
	projections still fail if the pole is in the domain - not sure why.
 * Implemented new, better downscaling-interpolation scheme, which handles
	the presence of a pole better, and take into account the irregular
	shape of the interpolation domain.
 * Added proper default initialisation of top-level glimmer type.
	
2004-05-12 Ian Rutt
 * Removed redundant re_alloc flag argument from proj_allocate subroutine
	in glimmer_project.f90

2004-05-11 Ian Rutt
 * Removed redundant xscale and yscale components from projection type, 
	which were originally set equal to dx and dy. All references to
	them have been changed accordingly.

2004-05-06 Ian Rutt
 * Rationalisation of calc_coverage (glimmer_object.f90), with 
	global grid objects.
 * Minor formatting changes.
 * Completed adding initialisation to derived types and rejigging
	namelist reads to avoid confusion about default values.
 * Coded alternative, hopefully faster calc_coverage routine.
 * Made efficiency alterations to new_upscale code.
 * Duplicated mean_to_global (glimmer_interp.f90) in single and
	double precision copies (in terms of array local) and
	added appropriate aliasing interface block. This was to
	allow the addition of a compile flag to invoke a single-precision
	interface (compile with GLIMMER_SP defined).
 * Corrected error in GMT code - sines and cosines being taken without 
	converting from degrees to radians!

2004-05-05 Ian Rutt
 * Realised several crucial aspects of the orography output were
	missing, so added them. Produces orography as expected now,
	but some structural changes are needed, I think.
 * Restructured code so that global grid definitions have their own 
	derived type, which simplifies things. However, more rationalisation 
	and simplification still possible
 * Minor formatting, and removal of redundant stress arrays

2004-05-04 Ian Rutt
 * Added upscale type to glimmer_interp.f90 and adjusted code 
  	accodingly. This was to enable the output of orography 
	at any resolution, as needed by the IGCM. 
 * ***NB*** This hasn't been tested properly yet, and the
	restarts have been broken by it, as there wasn't time
 	to add routine writing the upscaling to a restart file
 * Other minor formating changes, and addition of null pointer
	initialisation in some places

2004-04-27 Ian Rutt
 * Added doc comments to gmt.f90
 * Updated return value documentation throughout to !*RV
 * Other minor documentation and formatting changes
 * Moved glimmer_params initialisation to type definition
	in line with move to f95, and added null 
	initialisation for pointer arrays. (glimmer.f90)
 * Checked all elements of glimmer_params correctly
	included in restart routines and in consistent
	order. This should work OK, but hasn't been tested...

2004-04-26 Ian Rutt
 * Merged port_to_nag branch into HEAD
 * Extended interpolation routines (glimmer_interp.f90) to include 
	averaging high-resolution global field onto local
	grid. Also generalised find_ll_index somewhat to cope 
	with longitudes that have limits other than 0->360 
	(e.g. 180->360, 0->180). This may need more work, though.
 * Added matlab visualisation routines to the repository.

2004-04-19 Magnus Hagdorn
 * added ChangeLog
 * added NAG f95 makros
 * new build system (using Python script to work out module dependencies)
 * reduced number of time slices in example code to 10000yrs
 * made kind rk=dp (rather than 8)
 * (glimmer_outp.f90) integer array index
 * added SUN WS f95 makros
 * (glimmer_restart.f90, glimmer_interp.f90) workaround for SUN WS compiler bug
 * (glimmer.f90, glimmer_velo.f90) avoid division by zero
 * removed unused symbols and unused module symbols
