 * Merged port_to_nag branch into HEAD
 * Extended interpolation routines (glimmer_interp.f90) to include 
	averaging high-resolution global field onto local
	grid. Also generalised find_ll_index somewhat to cope 
	with longitudes that have limits other than 0->360 
	(e.g. 180->360, 0->180). This may need more work, though.
 * Added matlab visualisation routines to the repository.

 * (glimmer_outp.f90) integer array index
 * added SUN WS f95 makros
