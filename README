GLIMMER README file:
===================

GLIMMER is a land ice model designed to be used as part of 
an earth-system or climate model. Full documentation can be found 
in the doc directory. 

Licensing:
=========

GLIMMER is issued under the GNU General Public Licence. 
See LICENCE in the main directory.

Note that this licence DOES NOT APPLY to the SLAP linear algebra library, 
which is contained in its own directory, and is in the public domain.

Mailing list
============
There are two mailing lists:
1. the general user mailing list
   archive:   https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/glimmer-cism-user/
   subscribe: https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/glimmer-cism-user

2. the developer mailing list
   archive:   https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/glimmer-cism-devel/
   subscribe: https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/glimmer-cism-devel

Bugs:
====

Please send all bug reports (preferably with fixes!) to the glimmer mailing list:
glimmer-cism-devel@lists.berlios.de

Compiling:
=========

The model should build reasonably straightforwardly using make. 
Additional notes are provided in COMPILE in the main directory.
