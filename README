GLIMMER README file:
===================

GLIMMER is a land ice model designed to be used as part of 
an earth-system or climate model. Full documentation can be found 
in the doc directory. 

Licensing:
=========

GLIMMER is issued under the GNU General Public Licence. 
See LICENCE in the main directory.

Note that this licence DOES NOT APPLY to the SLAP linear algebra library, 
which is contained in its own directory, and is in the public domain.

Authors:
======= 

The original stand-alone ice model was written by Tony Payne. The 
subsequent coupling, down/up-scaling and other associated code (and
a significant amount of re-engineering of the original model) was
written by Ian Rutt.

Bugs:
====

Please send all bug reports (preferably with fixes!) to Ian Rutt
at the above address.

Compiling:
=========

The model should build reasonably straightforwardly using make. 
Additional notes are provided in COMPILE in the main directory.
