\section{Getting and Installing GLIMMER}
GLIMMER is a relatively complex system of libraries and programs which build on other libraries. This section documents how to get GLIMMER and its prerequisites, compile and install it. Please report problems and bugs to the \href{http://forge.nesc.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/glimmer-discuss}{GLIMMER mailing list}.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
GLIMMER is distributed as source code, a sane built environment is therefore required to compile the system. On UNIX systems \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{GNU make} is suggested since the Makefiles may rely on some GNU make specific features. There are two ways of getting the source code:
\begin{enumerate}
\item download a released version from the GLIMMER website, or
\item download the latest developers' version of GLIMMER and friends from \href{http://forge.nesc.ac.uk/}{NeSCForge} using \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/}{CVS}.
\end{enumerate}
If you want to build GLIMMER from CVS then you need GNU autoconf and automake to generate the built system and \href{http://www.python.org}{python} which is used for analysing dependencies and f95 code generation. Furthermore, the Python scripts rely on language features which were only introduced with python version 2.3.

GLIMMER is mostly written in FORTRAN95, a good f95 compiler is, therefore, required. GLIMMER is known to work with the NAGware f95, Intel ifort compilers. GLIMMER does not compile with the SUN WS 7.0 f95 compiler due to a compiler bug. The current SUN f95 compiler might work but has not been tested yet.

In addition to f90 and python you will also need {\LaTeX} if you want to build the documentation.

Glimmer uses the \href{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html}{netCDF} library for data I/O. You will most likely need to compile and install the netCDF library yourslef since the binary packages usually do not contain the f90 bindings which are used by GLIMMER.


\subsection{The GLIMMER Directory Structure}
The following commands describe the setup if you use the \texttt{bash} shell. The setup works similarly for other shells. We suggest that you install glimmer and friends in its own prefix, e.g. \texttt{/home/user/glimmer}. Assign the shell variable \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX} to this directory, i.e. \texttt{export GLIMMER\_PREFIX=/home/user/glimmer}. This directory will contain the following sub--directories:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{lp{9.5cm}}
   \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/bin} & executables are installed in this directory. Set your path to include this directory, i.e. \texttt{export PATH=\$PATH:\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/bin}.  \\
   \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/include} & include and f95 module files will be installed in this directory. If you want to compile your own climate drivers set the compiler search path to include this directory. \\
   \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/lib} & the libraries get installed here. Set your linker to look in this directory for the GLIMMER libraries if you want to compile your own climate drivers. \\
   \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/share} & data files get installed here.\\
   \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/src} & this is the only directory you need to create yourself. Unpack the GLIMMER sources here.
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}



\subsection{Installing a Released Version of GLIMMER}\label{ug.sec.tarball}
Download the GLIMMER tar--ball from the GLIMMER site and unpack it in the \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/src} directory using
\begin{verbatim}
tar -xvzf glimmer-VERS.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{VERS} is the package version.

The package is then compiled using the usual GNU sequence of commands:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --prefix=$GLIMMER_PREFIX [other_options]
make
make install
\end{verbatim}
The options and relevant environment variables are described in Table \ref{ug.tab.env}. 
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    Variable & Description \\
    \hline
    \texttt{FC} & f95 compiler to be used \\
    \texttt{FCFLAGS} & flags passed to the f95 compiler \\
    \texttt{LDFLAGS} & linker flags\\
    \hline
    Option  & Description \\
    \hline
    \texttt{--help} & print help \\
    \texttt{--prefix} & the installation prefix, e.g. \texttt{GLIMMER} \\
    \texttt{--with-netcdf} & prefix where the netCDF library is installed \\
    \texttt{--with-blas} & extra libraries used to provide BLAS functionality. A built--in, non--optimised version of BLAS is used if this option is not used. \\
    \texttt{--enable-doc} & build documentation.\\
    \texttt{--enable-profile} & enable profiling of GLIMMER (see Sec. \ref{ug.sec.profile})\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Environment variables and \texttt{configure} options used by GLIMMER.}
  \label{ug.tab.env}
\end{table}

\subsection{Installing from CVS}
Revisions of GLIMMER are managed using CVS. You can download the latest development version of GLIMMER using the following sequence of cvs commands:
\begin{verbatim}
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@forge.nesc.ac.uk:/cvsroot/glimmer login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@forge.nesc.ac.uk:/cvsroot/glimmer co glimmer
\end{verbatim}

The cvs version does not include some automatically generated files. In order to be able to compile the cvs version you need the GNU autotools and python. The built scripts are generated by running
\begin{verbatim}
./bootstrap
\end{verbatim}
in the \texttt{\$GLIMMER\_PREFIX/src} directory. The package is then configured and built as described in Section \ref{ug.sec.tarball}.


\subsection{Profiling}\label{ug.sec.profile}
If you run the \texttt{configure} script with the option \texttt{--enable-profile} you enable profiling of the model. By default times are integrated over 100 time steps. You can cheange this behaviour by setting the variable \texttt{PROFILE\_PERIOD}. The timing data is written to the file \texttt{glide.profile} which contains 5 columns of data (see Table \ref{ug.tab.profile_format}).
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Column 1 &total CPU time elapsed when data is written to file\\
    Column 2 &accumulated time spent on this block of calculations\\
    Column 3 &integer ID used to identify this block of calculations\\
    Column 4 &model year\\
    Column 5 &description of this block of calculations\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{File format of profile data file.}
  \label{ug.tab.profile_format}
\end{table}
A python script using the PyGMT library to visualise the profile is provided.
