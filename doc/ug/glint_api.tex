This appendix details the subroutine calls provided by GLINT, and their
arguments. Note that where a type is given as \texttt{real(rk)}, this
indicates that the kind of the real type is specified by the value of
the parameter \texttt{rk}, which may be altered at compile-time (see appropriate
other documentation for details).

\paragraph{Additional notes}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The ice model determines the size of the global domain from the sizes of
  the arrays \texttt{lats} and \texttt{longs}.
\item The latitudes contained in \texttt{lats} must be in descending order, so
  that $\mathtt{lats(i)}>\mathtt{lats(i+1)}$ for $1\leq \mathtt{i} \leq
  \mathtt{size(lats)}$.

\section{Subroutine \texttt{glint}}
%
\paragraph{Purpose}
%
To perform temporal averaging of input fields, and, if necessary, down-scale
those fields onto local projections and perform an ice model time-step. Output
files may be appended to, and if optional arguments used, fields made
available for feedback.

\paragraph{Additional notes}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The sizes of all two-dimensional fields passed as arguments must be the
  same as that implied by the sizes of the arrays used to pass latitude and
  longitude information when the model was initialised using
  \texttt{initialise\_glint}. There is
  currently no checking mechanism in place for this, so using fields of the wrong size
  will lead to unpredictable results.
\item Zonal and meridional components of the wind are only required if the
  small-scale precipitation parameterization is being used (with
  \texttt{whichprecip} set to 2). In other circumstances, \texttt{zonwind} and
  \texttt{merwind} must still be arrays of the correct rank, but need not be
  the correct size, or may be unallocated if desired.
\item The optional output fields only refers to the parts of the globe
  covered by the GLINT ice model instances. The fraction of each global
  grid-box covered by ice model instances may be obtained using the
  \texttt{glint\_coverage\_map} subroutine below. 
\item The output orography field is given as a mean calculated over the part
  of the grid-box covered by ice  model instances. Thus, to calculate the
  grid-box mean, the output fields should be multiplied point-wise by the
  coverage fraction. 
\item Albedo is currently fixed at 0.4 for ice-covered ground, and set to zero
  elsewhere. The albedo is given for the part of the global grid box covered
  by ice, not as an average of the part covered by the ice model. No attempt
  is made to guess the albedo of the parts of the ice model domain \emph{not}
  covered by ice.
\end{itemize}
%
\paragraph{Example interpretation of output fields}
%
Consider a particular point, $(i,j)$ in the global domain. Suppose value
returned by \texttt{glint\_coverage\_map} for this point is 0.7, and the
output fields have these values:
\begin{verbatim}
  orog_out(i,j)  = 200.0
  albedo(i,j)    =   0.4
  ice_frac(i,j)  =   0.5
\end{verbatim}
%
What does this mean? Well, the ice model covers 70\% of the grid-box, and in
that part the mean surface elevation is 200\,m. Of the part covered by the ice
model, half is actually covered by ice. Thus, 35\% ($0.5\times 0.7$) of the global grid-box is
covered by ice, and the ice has an mean albedo of 40\%. The model makes no suggestion for the
albedo or elevation of the other 65\% of the grid-box.
