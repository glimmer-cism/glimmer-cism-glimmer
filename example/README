This directory contains a very simple example program demonstrating how
a climate driver for the ice sheet model can be written.

In order to be able to use glide you need a f95 compiler. Set the 
environment variable FC to point to your f95 compiler. You also
need to set the variable GLIMMER_PREFIX to where glimmer is installed.
Finally you might need to set the variables FCFLAGS and LDFLAGS so
that the compiler and linker can find the netCDF library, e.g.
FCFLAGS=-I/path/to/netcdf/include
LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/netcdf/lib
